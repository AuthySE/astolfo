# Authy OneCode and Phone Verification Automated Testing Framework

This is a simple framework for you to test [Authy OneCode](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/authy/authy-totp) and/or [Authy Phone Verification](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/authy/authy-phone-verification-api) in an automated fashion.

The following tasks are performed during the execution of the tests:
* A new [Twilio Number](https://www.twilio.com/phone-numbers) is acquired
* A Webhook URL is set up for the Twilio Phone Number to forward the SMS messages generated by Authy OneCode and Phone Verification
* The Authy Phone Verification API is called and a SMS message delivered to the Twilio Number
* The Twilio Number forwards the message to the configured Webhook URL
* The framework receives that information and calls the Authy Phone Verification API to verify the code.
* The framework reports if the code is valid or not
* The Twilio Phone Number is registered against the Authy application
* The Twilio Phone Number Webhook URL is updated to reflect the new testing against the Authy OneCode API
* The Authy OneCode API is called and a SMS message delivered to the Twilio Number
* The Twilio Number forwads the message to the configured Webhook URL
* The framework receives that information and calls the Authy TOTP API to verify the code
* The framework reports if the code is valid or not
* The Twilio Number is released

## Quickstart

### Create a Twilio account

Create a free [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

Take note of your Account SID and Auth Token

### Create a new Authy application
Create a new Authy application [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/authy/applications)

Take note of your Production API Key available under Settings

## Setup the environment

This example assumes you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) already installed on your machine.

This project is built using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) web framework.

1. First clone this repository and then `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/mjabali/astolfo.git
   $ cd astolfo
   ```

1. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Export the required environment variable (TWILIO\_ACCOUNT\_SID, TWILIO\_AUTH\_TOKEN and AUTHY\_API\_KEY).

   ```bash
   $ export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=Your Twilio Account SID
   $ export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=Your Twilio Auth Token
   $ export AUTHY_API_KEY=Your Authy API Key

   ```
   If you are using a non-UNIX operating system, make sure that the TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN and AUTHY_API_KEY are loaded into your environment.

1. Open the config.js file and update the following arguments accordinly:
    
#### Arguments
* `phone_verification` _(boolean)_: Set it to true if you want to perform Authy Phone Verification tests.
* `pv_sms_url` _(string)_: The URL for the Phone Verification SMS Webhook. This is used by the framework to receive the SMS payload for verification. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local host. 
* `onecode` _(boolean)_: Set it to true if you want to perform Authy OneCode tests.
* `oc_sms_url` _(string)_: The URL for the OneCode SMS Webhook. This is used by the framework to receive the SMS payload for verification. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local host. 
* `aread_code` _(number)_: The desired area code for the Twilio Number to be created.
* `remove_number` _(boolean)_: Set it to true if you want to remove the Twilio Number after the tests.

Save the file.

## Run the server
1. Run the server with the following command.

   ```bash
   $ npm start
   ```

## Start the Testing Framework
1. Simply make a HTTP POST call to the http://<hostname>:<port>/start to start the testing framework.

That's it! The tests should be performed automatically for you.
